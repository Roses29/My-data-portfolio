## Portfolio Projects

### Personal projects

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis Project**

I performed exploratory data analysis on a football dataset, one of my passions. I first requested the data from an API provider, cleaned it in Excel, and then imported it into a Jupyter Notebook where I performed data analysis based on questions I developed. 

Python packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

You can find out more about the project by clicking the following link: [EDA Project Bundesliga](https://github.com/Roses29/My-data-portfolio/blob/main/EDA%20Bundesliga%202021-2022.ipynb)

**2. Data visualization with Power BI**

I built several dashboards of greenhouse gas (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) emissions trends in my country, Rwanda, and worldwide. I imported data into Power BI from an external source, cleaned and transformed data, and then created various charts. 

Data source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
