## Portfolio Projects

### Personal projects

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis Project**

I performed exploratory data analysis on a football dataset, one of my passions. I first requested the data from an API provider, cleaned it in Excel, and then imported it into a Jupyter Notebook where I performed data analysis based on questions I developed. 

Python packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
