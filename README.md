# Welcome to my portfolio page!

## About me
I'm a young professional seeking to transition into a data analytuics career, willing to apply and develop my skills in banking, finance, retail, healthcare, and sports, to name a few. Below, you can find my portfolio page where I showcase independent and course projects I have worked on along with the tools and libraries I have used.

## Technical skills
-Programming languages: **Python, SQL, R**

-Microsoft Tools: **Excel, Power BI**

-Other Tools and Methodologies: **Github, SQL Server Management Studio**

## Portfolio Projects

### Personal projects

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis Projects**

A. Football Dataset 

Performed exploratory data analysis on a football and dataset based on questions I developed. Requested the data from an API provider, imported and cleaned it in Excel, and did further cleaning and analysis in Jupyter Notebook. 

Python packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

B. Retail sales 

Performed data cleaning, transformation and analysis on a dirty retail store dataset from Kaggle. 

Python packages used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**2. Data visualization with Power BI**

Built several dashboards of greenhouse gas (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) emissions trends in my country, Rwanda, and worldwide. Imported data into Power BI from an external source, cleaned and transformed data, and created multiple charts. 

Data source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

### Course projects (from MIT's Data Science and Machine Learning online course)

**1.Hotel booking Cancellation Prediction**

Objectives:
- Analyzing data to identify the main factors that influence hotel booking cancellations.
- Building a predictive model that can predict which booking will be canceled in advance.
- Giving recommendations to hotels to assist them in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

 Python packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
 
 Machine Learning models used: Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest
