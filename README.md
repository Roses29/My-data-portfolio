# Welcome to my portfolio page!

## About me
I'm a young professional seeking to transition into a data science career, willing to apply and develop my skills in banking, finance, retail, healthcare, and sports, to cite a few. Welcome to my portfolio page where I showcase independent and course projects I have worked on and the various skills & methods I have used. 

## Technical skills
-Programming languages: **Python, SQL, R**

-Microsoft Tools: **Excel, Power BI**

-Other Tools and Methodologies: **Github, SQL Server Management Studio, Agile**

## Portfolio Projects

### Personal projects

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis Project**

Performed exploratory data analysis on a football dataset based on questions I developed. Requested the data from an API provider, cleaned it in Excel, and then imported it into a Jupyter Notebook. 

Python packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

You can find out more about the project by clicking the following link: [EDA Project Bundesliga](https://github.com/Roses29/My-data-portfolio/blob/main/EDA%20Bundesliga%202021-2022.ipynb)

**2. Data visualization with Power BI**

Built several dashboards of greenhouse gas (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) emissions trends in my country, Rwanda, and worldwide. Imported data into Power BI from an external source, cleaned and transformed data, and created multiple charts. 

Data source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
