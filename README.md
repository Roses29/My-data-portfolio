-Microsoft Tools: **Excel, Power BI**

## Portfolio Projects

### Python projects

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis Projects**

#### Retail sales 

Project in which I cleaned, transformed and analyzed a dirty retail store dataset from Kaggle. 

Python packages used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Full project and code can be found here: [Retail Sales Analysis](https://github.com/Roses29/My-data-portfolio/blob/main/Python_Project_Rubangura_Robin.ipynb)

#### Football Dataset 

Project in which I performed exploratory data analysis on a football dataset based on questions I developed. Requested the data from an API provider, imported and cleaned it in Excel, and did further cleaning and analysis in Jupyter Notebook. 

Python packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

**2.Hotel booking Cancellation Prediction**

Course project with the following bbjectives:

- Analyzing data to identify the main factors that influence hotel booking cancellations.
- Building a predictive model that can predict which booking will be canceled in advance.
- Giving recommendations to hotels to assist them in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

 Python packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
 
 Machine Learning models used: Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest

)

**3.Movie recommendation system**

Course project with the goal of building recommendation systems such as Rank-based & Collaborative Filtering-based to recommend movies to users.

Python packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Collections, Surprise

Machine Learning models used: KNN, SVD

### Greenhouses gases emissions visualization with Power BI

Built several dashboards of greenhouse gas (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) emissions trends in my country, Rwanda, and worldwide. Imported data into Power BI from an external source, cleaned and transformed data, and created multiple charts. 

Data source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
